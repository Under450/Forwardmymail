If our address is used at Companies House without an active, paid service (per entity/name), you authorise us to file forms (including RP07 or equivalents) to remove or change the address. Fees apply per company and per officer/PSC using our address.</p><p>A8. Termination. On termination of address services you must promptly update Companies House and all records. We will refuse new mail from the termination date. Items received after termination will be handled as follows: (a) Letters received within 14 calendar days after termination: one courtesy email notification; we will hold for up to 14 days, then Return to Sender where practicable; if no sender/return address is available, we will securely destroy after a further 14 days. (b) Parcels received within 14 calendar days after termination: we will hold for up to 7 days; if uncollected/unspecified, we may issue a Torts Act s.12 notice allowing at least 14 days to collect or arrange forwarding on payment of all sums due; failing that, we may sell or dispose and account for any net proceeds. (c) Any post received more than 14 days after termination will be refused or returned to sender on receipt, without notice.</p><p>A9. Immediate performance. By instructing us to file an incorporation or activate an address, you request immediate performance and acknowledge the effect on your cancellation rights (see Clause 15.3).</p><p>A10. Bank introductions. Where we provide bank or service introductions, these are without warranty; eligibility and onboarding decisions rest with the third party.</p><p>22. Schedule B - Client Authorisation: Receipt &amp; International Forwarding of Sensitive Mail</p><p>B1. Purpose. This authorisation confirms that the undersigned client authorises FMM to receive, open, scan, securely store and forward Sensitive Items on their behalf.</p><p>B2. Sensitive Items. “Sensitive Items” include: bank/credit/debit cards, PIN letters, cheque books, replacement security devices (e.g., card readers, tokens), and similar financial instruments. We may update this list from time to time.</p><p>B3. Preconditions. Sensitive Items will only be forwarded if: (a) the client has passed KYC/AML checks; (b) the issuer permits delivery to a mail‑forwarding address; (c) the Authorised Forwarding Address has been verified; and (d) the client has signed this Schedule.</p><p>B4. Method, opening &amp; security. FMM will use tracked and/or signed‑for services by default (unless you instruct otherwise in writing) and will record forwarding details internally. Our standard service includes opening mail and scanning contents; for Sensitive Items we will only scan with your explicit instruction and only where lawful and permitted by the issuer. We will not activate or test any card or device.</p><p>B5. Risk allocation. Once a Sensitive Item is handed to the Carrier for forwarding, risk passes to the client (see Clause 7.1). To the maximum extent permitted by law, FMM is not liable for delays, loss or misuse of Sensitive Items after dispatch, save where caused by FMM’s negligence. The liability limits in Clause 9 apply. The client indemnifies FMM for losses arising from issuer‑rule breach or misuse after dispatch.</p><p>B6. Refusal &amp; compliance. FMM may refuse, suspend or cancel forwarding of any Sensitive Item if compliance or security concerns arise, or if issuer, Carrier or legal restrictions apply.</p><p>B7. Client authorisation form. See separate PDF/DOCX form provided.</p><p>23. Schedule C - Service Rules &amp; Fees (Operational Policies)</p><p>C1. Status and updates. This Schedule sets out operational rules and fees for our services. It is incorporated by reference into the Terms. We may update this Schedule with prospective effect by notice on our website/in‑app/email.</p><p>C2. ID &amp; activation. Proof of identity and address is required for all relevant persons. Accounts remain inactive until payment is received and KYC/AML checks are completed. Annual ID refresh may be required.</p><p>C3. Mail handling windows. Letters held without charge for 14 days; parcels may accrue storage after 24 hours. After holding windows expire, items may be returned/destroyed/disposed of or stored for a fee. Disposal/return fees may apply.</p><p>C4. Opening &amp; inspection. We may open items to identify the recipient, comply with law, meet Carrier/customs requirements, repack damaged parcels, or for safety/security.</p><p>C5. Address restrictions. Do not use our address for DVLA driving licence/vehicle registration, electoral registration, or MLR registrations.</p><p>C6. Prohibited/restricted goods. You must comply with Carrier and law on dangerous goods (e.g., certain lithium batteries, aerosols, perfumes, controlled drugs). We may refuse or surrender items to authorities.</p><p>C7. Large parcels. Notify us 24 hours in advance for parcels over 1,000 mm in any dimension. We may refuse items over 2 m or 25 kg.</p><p>C8. Forwarding methods. Default to tracked/signed‑for unless you opt out in writing. If you arrange your own courier, a handling fee per item may apply (see Fees).</p><p>C9. Insurance. Goods are not insured on premises or in transit unless optional cover is purchased from us before dispatch. If you arrange your own courier, our insurance does not apply.</p><p>C10. Registered Office/Director’s Address. Official mail is included as stated in your plan. Non‑official mail requires an active Business Mailing Address plan. Unauthorised use at Companies House may be corrected by us via filings (including RP07). Fees apply per entity/name.</p><p>C11. Unclaimed/unknown mail. Items for unknown recipients may be held for up to 14 days then returned/destroyed/disposed of.</p><p>C16. No ongoing agency. After termination we do not act as agent to notify correspondents or authorities of your new address; you are responsible for updating records.</p><p>C15. Items received &gt;14 days post‑termination. Any postal items received more than 14 calendar days after termination will be refused on delivery or returned to sender on receipt, without notice.</p><p>C14. Post‑termination parcels. Parcels received within 14 calendar days after termination will be held for up to 7 days. If not collected or instructed for forwarding with payment of all sums due, we may issue a Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, s.12 notice allowing at least 14 days to collect or arrange forwarding, after which we may sell or dispose and account for any net proceeds after deducting sums properly due.</p><p>C13. Post‑termination letters. Letters received within 14 calendar days after termination will be held for up to 14 days following a single courtesy email to the account contact. Thereafter, letters will be returned to sender where practicable or securely destroyed after a further 14 days if no sender/return address is available.</p><p>C12A. Operational logs. We maintain internal handling and forwarding logs (including tracking references where available). Unless required longer by law or for ongoing disputes, we retain such logs for at least 12 months.</p><p>C12. Fees. See Schedule C‑1 for the current fee table; postage is additional.</p><p>24.
